//	Abstraction can be achieved through Interfaces in JAVA

//	An abstract class is something which is incomplete and you can not create an instance of the abstract class. 
//	If you want to use it you need to make it complete or concrete by extending it. 
//	A class is called concrete if it does not contain any abstract method and implements all abstract 
//	method inherited from abstract class or interface it has implemented or extended. 
//	By the way Java has a concept of abstract classes, abstract method but a variable can not be abstract in Java.

//	Use abstraction if you know something needs to be in class but the implementation of that varies

//	In Java, you can not create an instance of the abstract class using the new operator, 
//	its compiler error. Though abstract class can have a constructor.

//	abstract is a keyword in Java, which can be used with both class and method.  
//	Abstract class can contain both abstract and concrete method. An abstract method doesn't have the body, just declaration

//	If you know some of the behavior while designing class and that would remain 
//	common across all subclasses add that into an abstract class.
